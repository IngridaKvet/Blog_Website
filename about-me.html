            <p class="article__paragraph"><span class="bolder">I used to be a pack rat</span>. I had so many things that I thought that I loved, but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate any of it because there was too much.</p>
            <p class="article__paragraph">Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't want to live in, and I couldn't hold a relationship.</p>
            <h2 class="article__headline article__headline--lblue">How I turned things around</h2>
            <p class="article__paragraph"><span class="bolder">I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything</span>. I literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job.</p>
            <p class="article__paragraph">It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, I didn't know what else to do. And it worked</p>
            <h2 class="article__headline article__headline--lblue">Now I live the simple life</h2>
            <p class="article__paragraph">Now that I'm living a simple life things are so much better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time to enjoy.</p>
            <p class="article__paragraph">With how much it turned my life around, <span class="bolder">I felt like I had no choise but to start sharing how I did it</span>, and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I started this site!</p>
